## Character Writing
### General
1. Do not make your character OP. Take examples of the stats in the actual game(s) and base yourself around those.
2. Add flaws and qualities to your character.
3. Make your character psychologicaly logical. By that I mean, if they have a dark past, they might react negatively to certain situations that reminds them of said past.
4. Don't add powers that are irrelevant.
5. Don't make joke/troll OCs.
6. If you want to RP as canon characters, try to stick to them as much as possible. The FANDOM Wikis are your friends.
7. Add as much info as possible. If you want certain things to be kept secret, you can do so, but please keep in mind that even if you don't hide anything, the characters aren't supposed to know.
## In-RP
### General
1. Do not kill a character (whether it's your own or another player's) without the accordance of the other player and a _@Game Manager_.
2. Do not take an important decision that may change your character or the characters of other players without the approval of a _@Game Manager_.
3. Do not use emojis or text emojis while RP-ing.
4. If your character dies, then they're dead. You decided that your character would be dead. In certain very strict conditions, you may continue to RP as that character after they ressurect/re-spawn/ect.
4. If you are going to use markdown to differenciate certain things, then here's the format to follow:
> **Actions**  
> "Dialogue" / Dialogue  
> ("Thought") / _Thought_  
> [Apparté] / ((Apparté))  
5. Delete your Appartés after your RP partners have read them if they aren't necessary to the RP's understanding.
6. If you need a break, then take a break.
7. Don't start a fight over the RP. It's just a game.
8. If a character hasn't seen something happen, they shouldn't know about it (unless they have a strange power).  
If something is announced in _#📌🔴➖𝓔vents➖🔴📌_, the character needs to see it in a way or another.
